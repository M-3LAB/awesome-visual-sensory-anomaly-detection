This is the supplementary material of [A Survey of Visual Sensory Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07006). 

## What is Visual Anomaly Detection

Anomaly means a deviation from a rule or from what is regarded as standard, normal, or expected. 
The occurrence of anomalies is often difficult to predict and the baneful influence is difficult to estimate without distinguishing them.
Anomaly Detection(AD) has been identified as a significant research topic, especially in computer vision field. 
In this review, we focus on a challenging task, real-world anomaly detection in visual materials, in which anomaly can be a small defect in an industrial product, an unusual object in a driving scene, or an exceptional action in a video. 

## What is Sensory Anomaly Detection

Compare to semantic anomaly which is usually man-made accident at the level of tag categories, 
sensory anomaly is the natural matter of the senses. 
In another word, semantic anomaly refer to the whole sample(e.g., abnormal samples are drawn from different classes), while 
sensory anomaly is only a part of samples(e.g., a defect in an object).

## Awesome Researches

We collected outstanding anomaly detection papers in the last five years and classified them into tree level according to the form of anomaly. 

### Object-level AD
### Scene-level AD
### Event-level AD
