This list is the supplementary material of [A Survey of Visual Sensory Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07006). 

## What is Visual Anomaly Detection

Anomaly means a deviation from a rule or from what is regarded as standard, regular, or expected. 
The occurrence of anomalies is often challenging to predict, and the baneful influence is difficult to estimate without distinguishing them.
Anomaly Detection(AD) is an essential research topic, especially in the computer vision field. 
This review focuses on a challenging task, real-world anomaly detection in visual materials. An anomaly can be a minor defect in an industrial product, an unusual object in a driving scene, or an exceptional action in a video. 

## What is Sensory Anomaly Detection

Compared to the semantic anomaly, which is usually a manufactured accident at the level of tag categories, 
sensory anomaly is the natural matter of the senses. 
In other words, semantic anomaly refers to the whole sample(e.g., abnormal samples from different classes), while 
sensory anomaly is only a part of samples(e.g., a defect in an object).

## Awesome Researches

We collected outstanding anomaly detection papers in the last five years and classified them into three levels according to the form of anomaly. 

### Object-level AD
#### Unsupervised

#### Weakly Supervised
#### Supervised

### Scene-level AD
#### Weakly Supervised
#### Supervised

### Event-level AD
#### Unsupervised
