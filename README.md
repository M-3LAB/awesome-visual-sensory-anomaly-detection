##What is Visual Anomaly Detection

Anomaly means a deviation from a rule or from what is regarded as standard, normal, or expected. 
The occurrence of anomalies is often difficult to predict and the baneful influence is difficult to estimate without distinguishing them.
Therefore Anomaly Detection(AD) has been identified as a significant research filed. 
In this review, we focus on a challenging task, real-world anomaly detection in visual materials, in which anomaly can be a small defect in an industrial product, an unusual object in a driving scene, or a exceptional action in a video.
